# Development Log

## 2026-06-02 — Ana MVP skeleton

**Branch:** feature/data-prep  
**Owner:** Ana Valderrama  
**Session goal:** Scaffold the team repo and implement Ana's MVP (data pipeline, upload, backward analysis, guardrails, Streamlit, tests).

**What was built:**

- Full `config.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`
- `src/data_prep.py`, `zip_handler.py`, `backward_analysis.py`, `guardrails.py`, `agent_prompts.py`
- Teammate stubs: `mmm_model`, `optimizer`, `baseline`, `agent`, `explainer`
- Streamlit `app/app.py` + pages 1–2; pages 3–5 stubbed with optimization gate
- Tests for Ana modules (synthetic fixtures); integration smoke tests
- Notebooks `01_eda.ipynb`, `02_preprocessing.ipynb`
- Docs: architecture, data_pipeline, backward_analysis, agent_design, setup, optimization (draft)

**What still needs work:**

- Wire Gemini in `agent.py` (Piyush)
- MMM fitting and optimizer (Gregory, Meghna)
- Allocation and viz pages (Vikhyat)
- End-to-end test when all modules land

**Integration notes:**

- `run_pipeline(raw_path=...)` must be called after `confirm_and_save`
- Target column renamed to `y` after `aggregate_channels`; backward analysis checks both
- Optimization blocked until `st.session_state.backward_analysis_confirmed == True`

**How to test it:**

```bash
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
streamlit run app/app.py
```
